# Biography

 I study decision-making, specifically how social identity influences decisions and outcomes when bureaucrats interact with citizens. Additionally, I study how leaders in police organizations set norms and establish an organizational culture, and how this culture influences police performance and police-community relations.

 I also teach undergraduate courses on Writing and Communication in Public Affairs and Public Affairs Decision Making.
